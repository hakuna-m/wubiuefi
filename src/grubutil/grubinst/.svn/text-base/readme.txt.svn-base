1. Introdution

This utility is used to install GRUB4DOS boot code to the MBR or partition
boot sector of hard disk or image file.

grubinst.exe is a console mode program. It mimics the behavior of the DOS/Linux
utility bootlace.com from TinyBit's GRUB4DOS package. But unlike bootlace.com,
grubinst is writen completely in C and can be compiled to run in OSs like
Windows NT/2K/XP, Linux and FreeBSD.

grubinst_gui.exe is a GUI frontend to grubinst.exe. It provides a friendly
interface to users who are not familiar whith the command line environment.
Currently, grubinst_gui.exe only runs in Windows OSs.

Please note that these utilities only install MBR, it DOES NOT copy GRLDR to
your partition or configure menu.lst, neither does it modify boot.ini to enable
booting from the NT boot manager. To know more about such things, please refers
to readme file from the GRUB4DOS package.

Also note that the current version of grubinst doesn't support modify the MBR
of hard disk in Windows 95/98/ME. For those OSs, bootlace.com should be used
instead.
