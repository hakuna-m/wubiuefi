  * Don't fail if Windows' startup folder is missing or mis-
    configured (LP: #910948)
  * If bcdedit fails when uninstalling, it shouldn't be fatal
    (LP: #925779)
  * Don't use the diskimage download when the target 
    partition is FAT32 (LP: #882393).
  * Suppress "No Disk" popup errors for unsupported devices.
    Thanks to William Bass for the patch (LP: #365881).

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Remove partially downloaded files that Windows does not consider
    files when the bit torrent tracker falls over (LP: #873268).
  * Don't assume success if the disk image download fails without
    raising an exception (LP: #924752).
  * Hide Wubi from the autorun page, per LP: #975251.
  * Do not use the CD by default if we are not running Wubi from that
    same CD.
  * Remove the minimum ISO size check. This will fail on USB disks
    written into ISOs as part of the CD boot helper. It's not entirely
    clear why this was added in the first place (LP: #987402).

  * Bump to 11.10.
  * Remove Ubuntu Netbook option, which is no longer a separate CD
    (LP: #772941).
  * Switch to rootflags=sync for all filesystems.  ntfs-3g in oneiric now
    has syncio only as a compatibility synonym for sync.
  * Use grub-ntldr-img rather than our own copy of grubinst.
  * Declare --size as taking an int argument (LP: #799780).
  * Add the gzio module to the wubildr image, since normal.mod loads it
    unconditionally nowadays.
  * Remove grub-installer/bootdev_directory preseeding, only relevant for
    GRUB Legacy.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * In Vista and newer versions of Windows, boot straight into the
    second stage of the installer.
  * Merge with the diskimage branch. Wubi now downloads and expands a
    ext3 disk image by default, negating the need for a second stage.
  * Update Wubi icon. Still need to figure out why it's fuzzy in the
    Windows 7 taskbar.
  * Pre-allocate the swap file in disk image installs.
  * Add unit tests to wubi.
  * Properly parse the output of 7z's iso listing (LP: #856340).
  * Removed unused Ubuntu Netbook images (symlinks).
  * Use the Plymouth splash (LP: #862007).
  * Handle filesystem corruption when trying to uninstall Wubi

  * Add support for disk image installation (LP: #859696). Thanks
    Jean-Baptiste Lallement!
  * Correctly define cd_path (LP: #861702).
  * Drop vt.handoff for 11.10.  We'll fix this by including the correct
    GRUB modules in 12.04.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Bump to 10.10.

  * Pass '-O i386-pc' to grub-mkimage, required by GRUB snapshots from
    2010-05-17 onwards.
  * wubildr.cfg needs to be run using GRUB's normal parser rather than its
    rescue parser.  Rather than embedding it directly as a configuration
    file, embed it as a memdisk and add wubildr-bootstrap.cfg which invokes
    it using normal mode (LP: #600578).
  * Import KEY_SET_VALUE in win32 registry module.
  * Remove some unused or duplicate imports.
  * Add the font, gfxterm, and gettext modules to the wubildr image, to

    file. That grub bug (rev 1724) has now been fixed.  
  * Bumped preseed suite to lucid
  * Avoid error due to null cd_path (LP: #552357)
  * Fixed CD menu reboot (LP: #543032)
  * Safe graphic mode boot option was disabled (LP: #550539)

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Handle separate /boot in embedded grub.cfg (idea from Mark Abene in LP
    #477169).
  * Fall back to searching for /ubuntu/install/boot/grub/grub.cfg even if
    /ubuntu/disks/root.disk exists but is unusable (LP: #541607).
  * Skip " LTS" in .disk/info when comparing versions (see LP #558488).
  * Build-depend on gcc-multilib on amd64, so that 'gcc -m32' works.

  * Ubuntu Netbook Remix is now the Ubuntu Netbook Edition (LP: #541881).

  * Add support for Kubuntu Netbook Edition (LP: #402850).
  * Fix typos for netbook images in data/isolist.ini.
  * Support dashes in project names.  Thanks Steve Kowalik!
  * Factor in free space on the source device when calculating whether
    it's too big to use Wubi with.  This fixes using Wubi on
    sufficiently large USB disks.
  * Kubuntu Netbook Edition is now Kubuntu Netbook.
  * Use i386 if an amd64 version of the selected distribution does not
    exist.
  * Use the correct syntax for grub2 (elif does not exist).  Thanks to
    Colin Watson for the tip.
  * Use $default_filesystem in place of ext4.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use "new" simplified partman preseeding (actually available since
    hardy).
  * Pass rootflags= rather than ROOTFLAGS=, since as far as I can tell
    initramfs-tools ignores the latter.

  [ Hampus Wessman ]

  * Fixed the check for wine so that it looks in additonal places
  * Added tools/wine to the branch
  * Fixed a bug in virtualdisk.py
  * Added deletion of temporary directory
  * Fixed archive signature search in unpack.c
  * Removed some debugging code

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Fixed a typo in the translation template.
  * Require adminstrator privileges (LP: #340400).  Thanks Agostino Russo!
  * os.environ is a dictionary, not a callable method.
  * Only uncompress files in the boot directory (LP: #341640).  Thanks Agostino
    Russo!
  * Call the correct bootloader installation method for each version of
    Windows.
  * Use registry.{get,set}_value not the nonexistent
    registry.{get,set}_key.
  * Fix typo where a bcdedit command was accidentally created using
    concatenation.
  * subprocess.Popen takes a list of string arguments.
  * Bcdedit requires absolute paths.
  * There's no need to quote arguments to commands when using Popen.  It
    passes them straight through, so you'll get "Ubuntu Linux" instead of
    Ubuntu Linux.
  * Removed an erroneous closing parentheses in the use_cd check.

    directories.
  * Ensure that vista boot menu entry points to the correct wubildr file
    (LP: #358356)

    ubiquity-frontend-mythbuntu.
  * Check for preseed.$(distro) in the data directory before assuming that
    preseed.lupin should be used. (LP: #359834)
