wubi (10.04) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Agostino Russo ]
  * Fixed country and keymap detection (LP: #428575)
  * Added Chinese to language selector (LP: #468457)
  * The amd64 URL for Kubuntu was pointing to the i386 ISO (LP: #465936)
  * Boot.ini is not restored if drive letter is in upper case (LP:
    #400936)
  * Added traditional chinese to language list (LP: #468457)
  * Default to English if translations are not available (LP: #469131)
  * Better embedded grub.cfg, previous version was a workaround for a 
    grub2 bug that didn't allow us to test for the existance of a 
    file. That grub bug (rev 1724) has now been fixed.  
  * Bumped preseed suite to lucid
  * Avoid error due to null cd_path (LP: #552357)
  * Fixed CD menu reboot (LP: #543032)
  * Safe graphic mode boot option was disabled (LP: #550539)

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Handle separate /boot in embedded grub.cfg (idea from Mark Abene in LP
    #477169).
  * Fall back to searching for /ubuntu/install/boot/grub/grub.cfg even if
    /ubuntu/disks/root.disk exists but is unusable (LP: #541607).
  * Skip " LTS" in .disk/info when comparing versions (see LP #558488).
  * Build-depend on gcc-multilib on amd64, so that 'gcc -m32' works.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Bump to 10.04
  * Ubuntu Netbook Remix is now the Ubuntu Netbook Edition (LP: #541881).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Updated Ubuntu branding.  Thanks Michael Forrest!
  * str.replace() does not do in place modification of the string
    (LP: #567969).

wubi (9.10) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Agostino Russo ]
  * Upped references to 9.10/karmic
  * Synched grubutil branch with upstream
  * Do not show original absolute path of bytecompiled modules in error
    logs (LP: #389424)
  * Use sys.exc_info() in error logs as suggested by Colin J. Watson
    (LP: #389424)
  * Use --locale to select locale when starting wubi, thanks Adi Roiban
    (LP: #376890)
  * Fixed i18n errors in progress_page.py, thanks Adi Roiban (LP: #376925)
  * Fixed untranslatable string, thanks Adi Roiban (LP: #376457)
  * Spin-off of pypack, which turns a script into a self-contained
    directory with all required dependencies, might be useful to others
  * Now using grub2
  * Fixed typos in pypack
  * Updated grubutil to rev 31
  * Add grub modules in correct order
  * Fixed grub.cfg files
  * Ignore '-' in distro name (thanks Evan Dandrea)
  * Fixed typos in tasklist
  * Grub modules have been renamed upstream
  * Allow booting via the grub2 loopmount module

    installation time

  * Use ext4 by default (lp: #444214)
  * Support Japanese-multibyte usernames, patch provided by Jun
    Kobayashi, (LP: #452348)

  [ Michael Casadevall ]
  * Added support for UNR
  * Modified isolist.ini to represent new casper filename; capser.lz for lzma
    compressed initramfses

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Add support for Kubuntu Netbook Edition (LP: #402850).
  * Fix typos for netbook images in data/isolist.ini.
  * Support dashes in project names.  Thanks Steve Kowalik!
  * Factor in free space on the source device when calculating whether
    it's too big to use Wubi with.  This fixes using Wubi on
    sufficiently large USB disks.
  * Kubuntu Netbook Edition is now Kubuntu Netbook.
  * Use i386 if an amd64 version of the selected distribution does not
    exist.
  * Use the correct syntax for grub2 (elif does not exist).  Thanks to
    Colin Watson for the tip.
  * Use $default_filesystem in place of ext4.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use "new" simplified partman preseeding (actually available since
    hardy).
  * Pass rootflags= rather than ROOTFLAGS=, since as far as I can tell
    initramfs-tools ignores the latter.
